## Description v1.0

### Finding Items
Currently the new item will be spawned while searching various locations, e.g. Workbench, PlasticBox, Locker.
I have also added spawns for all items in various locations. Those are guaranteed. e.g. QuonsetGasStation, Dam, CampOffice.
Also, some items can be crafted.

### Adding Items
Using the [DeveloperConsole](https://github.com/FINDarkside/TLD-Developer-Console) Items can be manually added to your inventory with the command `add <GearName>`.
(e.g. `add Wallposterch`)
The item is fully integrated into the console and will appear in the auto-complete when pressing tab.
