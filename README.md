## Description v1.4
### New(1.4): My Pictures Feature ###
* MyPicturesMod.dll allows you to view PNG files in the **Mods\WallMyPictures** folder.<br> And You can edit and replace with another image. However, do not rename the file.


### Finding Items
- **Loot:** Currently the new item will be found while searching various locations, e.g. Workbench, PlasticBox, Locker.
- **Spawn:** I have also added spawns for all items in various locations. Those are guaranteed. e.g. QuonsetGasStation, Dam, CampOffice.
Also, some items can be crafted.<br>(**NOTE:** *Gearspawner spawns all gear only on the first visit to each location. In other words, all mod items will not spawn in locations you have already visited.*)

### Adding Items
Using the [DeveloperConsole](https://github.com/FINDarkside/TLD-Developer-Console) Items can be manually added to your inventory with the command `add <GearName>`.
(e.g. `add Wallposterch`)
The item is fully integrated into the console and will appear in the auto-complete when pressing tab.
